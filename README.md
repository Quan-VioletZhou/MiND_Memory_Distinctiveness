# MiND_Memory_Distinctiveness
Created by Violet Zhou for the Michigan Neural Distinctiveness Project

This is a repository to store the scripts we use for neuroimaging analysis during the fMRI memory task

We want to explore how neural activation in the whole brain area is different when people are trying to memorize object stimuli versus scene stimuli

All the shell and make files should be run in a Linux environment, while the R script should be run on a Windows environment
